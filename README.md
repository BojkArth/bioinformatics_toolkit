# bioinformatics_toolkit
A repository containing useful tools I developed and came across during my work in metagenomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and short read sequencing fields that might be of use to others. I will try to compartmentalize different functions and scripts by topic and provide worked out notebook examples where I have them at hand.
