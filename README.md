# bioinformatics_toolkit
A repository containing useful tools I developed and came across during my work in the fields of `metagenomics`, `single-cell transcriptomics`, and `short read sequencing` that might be of use to others. I will try to compartmentalize different functions and scripts by topic and provide worked out notebook examples where I have them at hand.
